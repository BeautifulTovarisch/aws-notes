# S3 - Simple Storage Service 101 #

Secure, highly available ( eleven 9s ), scalable object storage. Not for OSs or database storage. Spread across multiple devices and facilities.

## Basics ##

* 99.99% availability w/ 99.9% guaranteed
* 99.9999999% durability guaranteed
    - If you stored 10 million objects, on average you could lose 1 object every 10,000 years
* Upload object files
* Files can be 0-5TB
* Unlimited storage
* Stored in *buckets* ( folders )
    * Bucket names user-defined
    * Names must be universally global, DNS compliant
* Successful uploads return HTTP 200
* Tiered Storage
* Lifecycle management
* Encryption
* Access Control
    - ACLs, Bucket policies


## Data Consistency Models ##

* Read after Write ( PUTS )
    * Available to read immediately
* Eventual Consistency ( overwrites, deletes )
    * Not immediate

## Key Value Store ##

* S3 is object based
    - Key ( name )
    - Value ( data )
    - Version ID
    - Metadata
    - Subresources
        * Bucket policies, ACLs
        * CORS
        * Transfer Acceleration ( fast uploads for huge no. of files )

## Storage Tiers ##

* Standard: Regular use, frequent access. Can withstand the loss of two data centers simultaneously
* IA - Infrequently Accessed: "cold storage", cheaper to store but higher charges for reads
* S3 - One Zone IA: 20% less than IA, but only one AZ. 99.5% availability
* Reduced Redundancy: 99.99% availability and durability. Easily recreatable data. Not for mission-critical data. ( ex. Thumbnail ) ***Not Recommended***

* Glacier: **Very** infrequently accessed data. Retrieval takes between 3-5 hours. Archives. Much cheaper storage.

|Storage Class|Durability|Availability|Other|
|-------------|----------|------------|-----|
|Standard|99.9999999%|99.99%||
|Standard\_IA|""|99.9%|Retrieval Fee|
|Onezone\_IA|""|99.5%|Not protected against AZ loss|
|Glacier|""|99.99% after restore|3-5 hour access[^1]|
|RRS|99.99%|99.99%|Not Recommended[^2]|

[^1]: Can be expedited to minutes for increased fee

[^2]: AWS has lowered the cost of Standard S3, rendering this option virtually useless
