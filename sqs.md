# SQS - Simple Queue Service #

Gives access to a message queue. Distributed queue that allows messages generated by one component to be consumed by another. Oldest AWS service. **Pull-based** queue.

Makes decoupling components easier. Messages are failsafe, re-appearing in the queue automatically after a failed job. Can act as a buffer between components.

## Queue Types ##

- Standard
    - Nearly-unlimited number of messages
    - Cannot guarantee order
    - Could send duplicate messages at high loads
- FIFO ( first in first out )
    - Messages sent will be recieved in order
    - Messages are delivered once and made available until consumed

## Key Facts ##

- Pull-based, not pushed based
- Messages are 256KB in size
- Can be retained from 1 minute up to 14 days in queue
- Default retention is 4 days
- SQS guarantees messages will be processed at least once
- Visibility Timeout
    - Time that message is invisible in queue
    - Can become visible in queue before job is complete = duplicate processing
    - Maximum timeout 12 hours

## SQS Long Polling ##

Short polling returns immediately, long polling doesn't return until a message arrives in the queue. Can be used to save money. Avoids polling empty queue.
