## Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment ##

### Continuous Delivery ###

A workflow by which commits are built, tested, and prepared for release at a particular stage ( staging or production ). The release of the code is usually a manual decision/process.

### Continuous Deployment ###

Same steps as continuous delivery except code is automatically deployed at the end of the pipeline. Process is fully automated. Small changes are deployed frequently.
